                    <div>If you decide to go to Germany on Christmas, you will certainly find numerous and large Christmas markets. Even you can discover some which were founded in the 15th century.
                        The period during which you can visit these markets can be different. For example, in one town it can be just 2 days, while in other several weeks.
                        The main attraction of these places is roasted chestnuts. They are sold everywhere. When you feel their delicious smell, you won’t be able to leave any of the numerous markets.
                        One of the traditional Christmas foods in Germany is Lebkuchen. It is a kind of biscuit with icing and almonds.</div>

                    <div><h2>Buche de Noel, France</h2></div>
                    <div>This name is translated as “Yule Log” from French. It is connected with the Viking times when it became a tradition to burn a large log on dark nights. It was normally done during the winter solstice. But when the years passed, that tradition was not observed as before.
                        One of the reasons is cutting down the trees in the forests. To stick to the custom, people created this cake, which is some kind of Swiss roll. You need to fill it with chocolate buttercream. To make it look nice and like a log, grate some chocolate over the cake and add pine needles.</div>

                    <div><h2>Panettone, Italy</h2></div>
                    <div>This cake was invented in Italy. The legend tells about one boy who was in love with a girl and wanted to try all ways to get her attention. He chose one of the most creative ways.
                        The boy made up his mind to bake an amazing and delicious cake. What was it like? He made an incredible high bread loaf.
                        Its exquisite taste was completed with raisins, lemon zest, and candied orange. Nobody knows the result of the boy’s efforts. But surely it became a traditional Christmas food in Italy.
                        Making panettone is a long process. You will spend that no less than 3 days. First, it was baked in Milan, but nowadays panettone is made around the world. For example, Latin America is famous for this cake.</div>

                        The hosts usually treat these people with ponche and snacks. After that, they go together to the next neighbor.
                        It can be difficult to prepare treatments for so many people. But still, they manage.</div>

                        Also to cook it you need eggs and coconut. Its texture is chewy. While making this cake, people wrap it in banana leaves and put it into the oven.
                        But the oven is not usual; it should be a clay oven. At the end of the baking process, it will be nice to grate coconut over the cake and put a few slices of duck egg.</div>
